# Codegraph research — discover structure with mmcg

The shared structural discovery layer for Mastermind. Claims about symbol
existence, indexed callers, imports, and bounded blast radius come from a fresh
mmcg result rather than memory. Exact source contracts and runtime behavior come
from source reads and tests.

The graph is syntactic evidence with name-based target candidates, without
compiler/type resolution. Dynamic dispatch, reflection, generated code,
re-exports, and cross-language edges can reduce precision.

**Never name a symbol, file, caller, or blast radius from memory.** "I think `X` exists" is not evidence; `mmcg_search X` returning a hit is. A spec, audit, or critique built on a guessed symbol fails at the first step that touches real code.

## Effort selection at handoff

Before starting a research agent, use [[mastermind-agent-handoff]] to select and
apply effort to the ordinary spawn. Preserve the source/map bindings and carry
facts and gaps when the duty changes. Source and citation checks below still
apply.

## Structural vs literal

- **Bounded orientation** (relevant changes, symbols, callers, tests, and history
  for a role) → one `mmcg_brief` before broad discovery.
  Use its aggregate `disciplines` to route needed evidence: inspect frontend
  interaction states, QA coverage, or migration data and rollback boundaries
  when those disciplines are detected. The classifier is path-based and is not proof
  of behavior; a scope-incomplete signal means it classified only returned
  changed files.
- **Concept discovery** (the intent is known but the exact symbol is not) →
  Before retrieval, freeze a query-only `request_contract`: the requested
  `operation` and exact quoted `constraints` with unique `id`, original-query
  `text` and `kind` (`input`, `state`, `scope`, `result`). Pass it to
  `mmcg_concept_prepare`, inspect the bound source, then `mmcg_concept_finish`.
  The original query stays authoritative if that ledger is incomplete or
  mistaken. Omitting it supplies the whole query as the operation with an empty
  parsed ledger; it does not remove any original constraint.
  Supply alternative implementation vocabulary in optional `hints` when the
  request uses different words; preserve the original query as the criterion.
  Assess the requested action, object and constraints for every candidate.
  Topic mentions, unrelated dispatch and neighboring operations are insufficient.
  Follow `operation-roles-v3`: relevant entries declare `implementation`,
  `entrypoint`, `contract`, `essential_helper` or `supporting_context`.
  First identify the candidate's own observable behavior, then its relationship
  to the operation. A concrete branch inside a broad handler or file module may
  own or expose the operation through a mandatory inspected path; delegation
  alone does not reduce it to context. A helper need not implement the whole
  workflow, but being mandatory or running earlier is insufficient: its own
  behavior must perform a defining domain step or enforce a requested constraint.
  Useful generic readiness, configuration or lifecycle prerequisites remain
  context. Bind non-implementation
  roles to inspected caller/consumer/implementation source ranges through
  `supporting_evidence`; entrypoints/contracts/helpers require evidence outside
  their own declaration. Generic call-graph membership is insufficient.
  Admit context only for specific inspected navigation to an existing requested
  operation satisfying every explicit constraint. Opposite or missing behavior,
  a narrower scope, or a place to add the feature is irrelevant. An uninspected
  constraint stays unknown. Prefer semantic roles for necessary steps and
  specific result entrypoints, including cached-result paths.
  Relevant entries require a typed `witness` with own `behavior`, `relation` and
  `constraint_checks`. Cover every declared constraint exactly once by
  `constraint_id`, `status=matched` and inspected source-bound `evidence`.
  Contradicted checks require irrelevant; uninspected checks require unknown,
  including for context. Preserve input options separately from runtime state
  and result conditions: an omitted selector does not establish absent binding,
  and rendering instructions does not execute the requested action.
  Record unresolved intent in `query_ambiguities`; useful results for an
  ambiguous query may only be supporting context under a plausible original
  interpretation that retains every explicit constraint. The full `candidates` page
  preserves navigation. Use its `semantic_candidates` partition for operation
  claims and retain `supporting_context` separately.
  Read beyond incomplete excerpts when needed; otherwise keep the candidate
  unknown. The calling agent supplies judgments; the server checks source
  bindings, completeness and declared consistency, not semantic truth. Reprepare
  after a role-contract change. Retrieval limits and unknowns prevent an absence claim.
  Use `mmcg_concept` for a fast lexical shortlist, then read source; its score
  does not establish operation relevance. Query only returned symbol names.
- **Structural discovery** (symbols, indexed callers/callees, imports, bounded blast radius) → mmcg first. It understands syntax better than literal text search, but remains name-based and bounded.
- **Literal** (string contents, log messages, comments, config values) → `Grep` / `Read`. The persistent symbol index omits strings; operation review may read bounded source bodies.
- **Runtime contract** (dynamic dispatch, reflection, generated code, re-exports, cross-language edges, exact branch behavior) → read source and run focused tests.

## Query decision table

| Question | Tool |
|---|---|
| What bounded context does this planner/executor/auditor need? | `mmcg_brief` |
| Which declarations implement this operation? | `mmcg_concept_prepare`, source reads, `mmcg_concept_finish` |
| Which declarations have these lexical terms? | `mmcg_concept` |
| Does symbol `X` exist? (get `file:line` + signature) | `mmcg_search` |
| Where are several already-known symbols defined? | `mmcg_search` with `names` when the advertised schema supports it |
| What calls `X`? | `mmcg_callers` |
| Where is `X` used as a function value or inside a Rust macro body? | `mmcg_callers` with `edge_kind: references` |
| What does `X` call? | `mmcg_callees` |
| Which indexed dependencies may be affected by changing `X`? | `mmcg_impact` |
| What does file Y import? | `mmcg_imports` |
| Who imports `X` / this path? | `mmcg_imported_by` |
| Does this file path exist in the index? | `mmcg_files` |
| Is the index ready / how stale is it? | `mmcg_status` |
| What prior rationale or decision records discuss this topic? | `mmcg_history`, then read the cited records |
| String contents / comments / log lines | `Grep` |
| File-name / extension globs | `Glob` |

Batch already-known names rather than rediscovering each separately. Batch search
returns ordered `queries`; inspect each one's collisions, truncation and precision
before choosing a definition. Its `top` defaults to 10 and accepts at most 25
per name. Reuse a previously observed location while its source/index binding
remains current; a missing or incomplete result still needs investigation.

`mmcg_callees` selects one definition. Check `match_status`: when `ambiguous`,
choose a returned candidate using its exact indexed `file` and declaration
start `line`, then query again. An empty list with `not_found` or `ambiguous`
does not describe the outgoing edges of a selected symbol.

Callers and callees default to `edge_kind: calls`; use `references` for indexed
function-value and macro-body usages. References are dependencies to inspect,
not proof of invocation. Impact traverses both kinds conservatively. Preserve
`edge_kind`, `target_resolution`, and `precision_notes` with the result. Even
with `truncated: false`, a zero result does not establish complete runtime
reachability, and an unreferenced candidate is not proof of dead code. Rust
macro bodies provide bounded syntactic references; macros are not expanded.
Unsupported or over-budget macro bodies and wildcard-imported function values
can be omitted. Query truncation does not measure extraction completeness.

Use the smallest evidence set that answers the question. A normal symbol lookup
may need one source read; a collision, meaningful zero, or contradiction may
need several. Name the unresolved fact before another scoped query or read.
For the bounded researcher role, aim for four calls and stop at eight, handing
off the exact missing evidence. Do not use that allowance to recursively trace
callers or expand into architectural decisions or broad bug diagnosis.

For documentation claims, read the relevant current implementation and report
disagreement explicitly. History search retrieves records; it does not decide
which record is authoritative. Follow ADR supersession links, check each
status, and compare the accepted decision with current code/configuration.
Newer dates, file order, and repeated claims do not establish adoption. A
proposed ADR is not an accepted replacement. The planner owns decisions;
unresolved bug diagnosis goes to the investigator with observed facts and gaps.

**mmcg-first:** use the graph to find candidate symbols and impact, then read the
source needed for the decision. Re-check with literal search or another source
when collisions/precision warnings are present, a security-sensitive path is at
stake, a meaningful zero-result could change the decision, or the language
feature is outside the graph's precision envelope. Do not repeat equivalent
searches when the indexed result already answers a low-risk discovery question.
Do not use Bash to rediscover symbols, files, callers, imports, or impact from a
fresh, complete graph response. Bash remains appropriate for Git, builds,
tests, linters, logs, and runtime probes.

## Stale or unavailable index

- No mmcg response → mmcg is unavailable. For a low-risk task, proceed
  with source inspection and state the limitation. Stop for user/planner review
  only when the missing structural evidence is load-bearing to scope or safety.
- A structural query refreshes a stale managed index once before answering. If
  that bounded refresh fails, preserve `index_stale` or
  `refresh_limit_exceeded` and use a source fallback; do not retry in a loop.
- A custom external index is read-only and must be refreshed explicitly with
  `mastermind index`. Use `mmcg_status` only for diagnosis or after a warning,
  not as a mandatory first call.

## Citations

Whenever you read code or report a structural fact, carry the `file:line`. Downstream agents (planner, auditor) need precise locations to act — a finding without a citation is unverifiable and gets treated as a guess.

## Don't guess

Catch yourself guessing a signature, a path, or a caller count → query the graph
or read the source. Preserve `stale`, collision, precision, and truncation
metadata with any downstream claim.

## Epistemic envelope

For any conclusion that changes scope, risk, or implementation, separate:

- **Observed** — direct graph result, source line, test output, or runtime fact.
- **Inferred** — the conclusion drawn from those observations and why it follows.
- **Unknown** — missing evidence that could change the conclusion.
- **Confidence** — `high`, `medium`, or `low`, plus a concrete reason. Never derive
  confidence from the number of search hits alone.
- **Would change this conclusion** — the contradictory source, runtime result,
  collision resolution, or fresh index result that would falsify it.

Do not hide a speculative leap inside an observed-facts paragraph. A zero result
means "not found in this index under this query," not "does not exist."
